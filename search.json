    "text": "Here is the general idea on how nonequilibrium thermodynamics was used to create an algorithm for generative modelling:\n\nConvert images to a simple noise distribution\nReverse the process by using the distribution to create new images.\n\nTo understand how this works, the article titled “The Physics Principle That Inspired Modern AI Art” described the process best. Suppose we have a grayscale image consisting of two pixels, with different grayscale values. If we plot the 2D plot of this, with each axis representing the grayscale values, we get a single point.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits import mplot3d\n\nnum1 = np.random.randint(0,256)\nnum2 = np.random.randint(0,256)\nx = np.array([[num1,num2]])\nplt.figure(figsize = (12,6))\n\nplt.subplot(121)\nplt.imshow(x, vmin = 0,vmax = 255, cmap = 'gray')\nplt.xticks([])\nplt.yticks([])\nplt.title(\"grayscale values: \" + str(num1) + \" and \" + str(num2))\n\nplt.subplot(122)\nplt.scatter([num1],[num2])\nplt.xlabel('image grayscale 1 value')\nplt.ylabel('image grayscale 2 value')\nplt.xlim(0,256)\nplt.ylim(0,256)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we have let’s say 20 grayscale images consisting of two pixels each and plot the grayscale values in the 2D plot, we notice that some points are closer to each other than other points. Then we can actually use this 2D plot to generate a 2D probability distribution function such that if we want to generate a new image, we just select a point from our distribution function and the result will give us the values of the pixels of our image, which is a combination of all the images from where we got the probability distribution from, with the images that clustered together having the highest similarity.\n\n\nCode\nnum1_list = []\nnum2_list = []\n\nplt.figure(figsize = (12*1,6*1.5))\n\nfor i in range(20):\n    plt.subplot(5,4,i+1)\n    num1 = np.random.randint(0,256)\n    num2 = np.random.randint(0,256)\n    num1_list.append(num1)\n    num2_list.append(num2)\n    x = np.array([[num1,num2]])\n    plt.imshow(x, vmin = 0,vmax = 255, cmap = 'gray')\n    plt.xticks([])\n    plt.yticks([])\n    plt.title(\"grayscale values: \" + str(num1) + \" and \" + str(num2), fontsize = 8)\nplt.show()\n\nplt.figure(figsize = (6,6))\nplt.scatter(num1_list,num2_list)\nplt.xlabel('image grayscale 1 value')\nplt.ylabel('image grayscale 2 value')\nplt.xlim(0,256)\nplt.ylim(0,256)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we extend this to an actual image, we get an N-D plot depending on the number of pixels of our image, with the simplified explanation still holding true. And the challenge now for researchers is how to generate this complicated probability distribution function.\nPitfall encoutered: Images formed just looked like blobs, but still cool! The general ‘shape’ was there, but in blob form."

    "text": "Training Language Models\nFocusing on the transformer models, we need to know how the neural network model is being trained: including the pre-training and fine-tuning processes. In pre-training process, we provide a general language model that has a good understarding of how language is being used in a variety of settings.\nFor a neural network, we use \\(n\\) inputs and then it is processed in several hidden layers until it reaches an output layer. Ideally, we want the output of our neural network to be close to the actual/real output. If that is not the case, then we use gradient descent to change the parameters to reduce the loss function of our network. In gradient descent, what happens is we use the output and compute some values and then feed it back to our hidden layers until the loss is minimized, which is why the process is also called backpropagation, see Figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Simplified Neural Network\n\n\nOne problem of the neural network above is that the input size is fixed and in general, we would want to process input sizes that are longer or shorter. Now in the field of language moelling, there are two types of networks that were considered state of the art: recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory networks.\n\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs)\nIn a recurrent neural network, we still have the same neural network discussed above to every word in a series of words. Whats different for RNNs is that last word (newest word) in the sequence of words has the most influence in choosing the next word and the probability of influence of previous words reduce exponentially as new words are being introduced. We see in Figure 3 how RNNs are able to connect information (or words) in a sequential manner.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Recurring Neural Network\n\n\nThis makes sense but the problem is, language in itself is more nuanced in the sense that sometimes we need to take into account not only the last word in our sentence but the sentence as a whole. For example, in Figure 3, if we need the output \\(h_{10}\\), the information from the input \\(x_1\\) has very little effect on the output and this might pose a problem if we are for example dealing with a sentence whose subject and verb are very far from each other. Because of this unique feature of language, the concept of older worlds having less influence becomes a bug and is called the vanishing gradients problem\n\n\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) networks\nNow LSTMs solve the vanishing gradients problem by introducing a “memory” state whose influence is determined by gates defined by more learnable parameters. The main difference of LSTM fromm RNN is that the former type of network remembers information for long periods of time by default but has there functions, called gates that can either use the information stored to process the output or to “forget” the previous information and not use for the output.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Long Short-Term Memory Network\n\n\nIn an LSTM network, there are three gates that are needed to pass through. First is the gate that chooses which information to forget, then the second gate decides which information to store. In the second gate, we have two functions which decides which values will be updated and what values will be used to update. Lastly, the third gate will decide which information will be the output.\nDrawback of RRN and LSTM Now, while both networks are successful in predicting the next word given a series of words, one major drawback of these two networks is that they require their input data to be processed sequentially, that is in order to process the next word of input \\(x_i\\), we need the result of the previous input \\(x_{i-1}\\).\nThe attention mechanism addresses this issue by stacking the input in a matrix such that they can all be processed at the same time. According to the paper “Attention is all you need”, the authors defined the attention function as the following:\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum  of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\nNow, the attention mechanism is used in a neural network architecture called a transformer.\nHere is how the transformer neural network works:\n\nTokenization\n\nTokenization is the process of converting words or any natural language to tokens which are the ones processed by our computers. There are three main approaches in tokenization which are the following:\n\nWord-based: Split a sentence on spaces where generally, punctuation marks are also split into different tokens.\nSubword-based: Split words into subwords. Example would be “o c ca sion”.\nCharacter-based: Split sentence into individual characters.\n\nFor example, taking the sentence “Once again Mr. Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary.”\nUsing the fastai module in Python, we can implement the different types of tokenization. For example, for word tokenization, we have the following code and output\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom fastai.text.all import *\npath = untar_data(URLs.IMDB)\n\nfiles = get_text_files(path, folders = ['train', 'test', 'unsup'])\ntxt = files[0].open().read()\nprint(\"Original Sentence:\")\nprint(txt[:77])\nprint()\nspacy = WordTokenizer()\ntoks = first(spacy([txt[:77]]))\nprint(\"Word Tokenization:\")\nprint(coll_repr(toks, 30))\n\n\nOriginal Sentence:\nOnce again Mr. Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary.\n\n\n\nWord Tokenization:\n(#15) ['Once','again','Mr.','Costner','has','dragged','out','a','movie','for','far','longer','than','necessary','.']\n\n\nTokenization is an important step in the neural network architecture since it converts the natural language that we understand to these tokens that can be understood by our machines after converter them to numbers, a process called Numericalization which can also be done using the fastai module.\nNow that we have the numbers that our computer can process, we can actually now split them into 3 batches: training, validating, and testing batches. We put the training batch in a chosen language model and then validate the results. Now after training our model, we can now actually specify the things that our model can do. In the following chapter, we discuss some of the things that language models can actually do."

    "text": "Different things models for NLP can do!\nText Classification\nThere are two types of classification wherein NLP models are very useful for: binary classification and multi-label classification. Binary classification is useful in sentiment analysis where texts can be labeled as something good or bad which can help informed decisions in fields like politics, and marketing. Multi-label classification on the other hand is useful in organizing and filtering tons of information in social media and news for example.\nToken Classification\nIn token classification, we classify the tokens produced after the tokenization process. This is actually useful for example in in labeling tokens specifically those that can be categorized as people or entities that need to be identified. Another thing that this is useful for is for identifying which part of speech certain words/tokens are. We can actually use NLP models to create those tree diagrams where a sentence can be broken down into different part of speeches!\nTranslation\nOf course, a common application of NLP models is for translating a language to another. Language models learns the structure of the input so that it can be able to translate it to another language with the use of transfer learning models. These transfer learning models are actually useful in order to reduce the time it would take the model to train.\n\nQuestion Answering\nNow, one of the most commonly seen application of language models is this question answering. Siri, Alexa, Bixby, and Google Assistant are examples of some end-user products that uses language model to answer day to day questions of people. And because of the sudden interest of the general public to these language models (ChatGPT for example), many researchers and developers have actually made their pre-trained models open access, which means they are publicly available for non-commercial use. An example of this would be the alpaca.cpp which makes use of the LLaMA foundation model with some finetuning mechanisms and a couple tweaks to make it into a chat interface. Here is a sample gif of how it works. It’s basically a locally run ChatGPT!\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Example of alpaca.cpp"

For the word-based tokenization, we use the following block of following code:\n\nfrom fastai.text.all import *\npath = untar_data(URLs.IMDB)\n\n\nfiles = get_text_files(path, folders = ['train', 'test', 'unsup'])\n\n\ntxt = files[0].open().read(); txt[:77]\n\n'Once again Mr. Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary.'\n\n\n\nspacy = WordTokenizer()\ntoks = first(spacy([txt[:77]]))\nprint(coll_repr(toks, 30))\n\n(#15) ['Once','again','Mr.','Costner','has','dragged','out','a','movie','for','far','longer','than','necessary','.']\n\n\nFor subword tokenization:\n\ntxts = L(o.open().read() for o in files[:2000])\ndef subword(sz):\n    sp = SubwordTokenizer(vocab_sz=sz)\n    sp.setup(txts)\n    return ' '.join(first(sp([txt]))[:40])\nsubword(1000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'▁O n ce ▁again ▁M r . ▁Co st n er ▁has ▁ d ra g g ed ▁out ▁a ▁movie ▁for ▁far ▁long er ▁than ▁ ne ce s s ar y . ▁A side ▁from ▁the ▁ ter'\n\n\nTokenization is an important step in the neural network architecture since it converts the natural language that we understand to these tokens that can be understood by our machines after converter them to numbers, a process called Numericalization which can also be done using the fastai module.\nNow that we have the numbers that our computer can process, we can actually now split them into 3 batches: training, validating, and testing batches. We put the training batch in a chosen language model and then validate the results. Now after training our model, we can now actually specify the things that our model can do. In the following chapter, we discuss some of the things that language models can actually do.\n\n\nDifferent things models for NLP can do!\nText Classification\nThere are two types of classification wherein NLP models are very useful for: binary classification and multi-label classification. Binary classification is useful in sentiment analysis where texts can be labeled as something good or bad which can help informed decisions in fields like politics, and marketing. Multi-label classification on the other hand is useful in organizing and filtering tons of information in social media and news for example.\nToken Classification\nIn token classification, we classify the tokens produced after the tokenization process. This is actually useful for example in in labeling tokens specifically those that can be categorized as people or entities that need to be identified. Another thing that this is useful for is for identifying which part of speech certain words/tokens are. We can actually use NLP models to create those tree diagrams where a sentence can be broken down into different part of speeches!\nTranslation\nOf course, a common application of NLP models is for translating a language to another. Language models learns the structure of the input so that it can be able to translate it to another language with the use of transfer learning models. These transfer learning models are actually useful in order to reduce the time it would take the model to train.\nQuestion Answering\nNow, one of the most commonly seen application of language models is this question answering. Siri, Alexa, Bixby, and Google Assistant are examples of some end-user products that uses language model to answer day to day questions of people. And because of the sudden interest of the general public to these language models (ChatGPT for example), many researchers and developers have actually made their pre-trained models open access, which means they are publicly available for non-commercial use. An example of this would be the alpaca.cpp which makes use of the LLaMA foundation model with some finetuning mechanisms and a couple tweaks to make it into a chat interface. Here is a sample gif of how it works. It’s basically a locally run ChatGPT!\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Example of alpaca.cpp"
